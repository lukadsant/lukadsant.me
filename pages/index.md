Hey! I'm Luka D’Sant — a developer who loves to explore the intersection between technology, creativity and curiosity.

Working at {Faculdade Pernambucana de Saúde} as a back-end developer.<br>
Building APIs, microservices, and intelligent systems with {Go} {Python} {Java} {PostgreSQL}.

Fascinated by how things connect — from networks and security to artificial intelligence and automation.
Currently diving deep into {cyberops}, {networking fundamentals}, and the art of making systems both powerful and secure.

I learn best by breaking things down and rebuilding them.
That’s what this space is about — documenting what I discover, how I learn, and the small experiments that turn theory into reality.
You can read my learning posts or check some projects.

From time to time, I explore creative coding, automation, and data visualization — small pieces that combine logic and design.

Outside of code, I enjoy photography, music, and late-night ideas under the acacias 🌙 — moments where art and technology quietly meet.
